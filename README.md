# Space Worm - WASM Edition

A classic Snake-inspired game written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for web browsers. 

The player controls a space worm that grows longer as it eats food while avoiding collisions with itself. Every 1000 points, players are eligible to choose special perks that enhance gameplay.

## üéÆ Cross-Platform Gaming

This game is designed to run seamlessly across all modern web browsers in Desktop and mobile environments. It detects the platform and adjusts controls accordingly:
- **Desktop**: Uses keyboard keys WASD for movement and spacebar for perks
- **Mobile**: Touch controls with on-screen buttons for movement and perks

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable)
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) for WASM compilation

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hvalfangst/rust-space-worm-game-wasm.git
cd rust-space-worm-game-wasm

# Build WASM package
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg --out-name space_worm

# Copy assets and files
cp -r pkg/ www/
cp -r assets www/

# Serve locally (Python 3)
cd www
python -m http.server 8000
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000
```

### Build Scripts
The project includes several utility scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

- **`build-wasm.sh`**: Builds the WASM package and copies files to www/
- **`serve.sh`**: Starts a local development server
- **`deploy.sh`**: Production deployment script

## üîÑ CI/CD & Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Automated deployment to **GitHub Pages** using  script [deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml), 
which does the following on pushes to main:
1. Sets up the Rust toolchain with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
2. Installs `wasm-pack` for WASM compilation
3. Builds the project using `cargo build` and `wasm-pack`
4. Copies assets and creates a `.nojekyll` file
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages using the official actions
